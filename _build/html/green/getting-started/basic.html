<h2>Logging In<a class="headerlink" href="#logging-in" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After you have created your wallet, you will be presented with a login screen when you
open the app.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/PIN.png"><img alt="../../_images/PIN.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/PIN.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>Here, you can enter your PIN, which will grant you access to your wallet. This will work
in the vast majority of situations.</p>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Attention</p>
<p>If you have forgotten your PIN, you will need to enter your 24-word mnemonic to access
your wallet. After you have done this, you will be prompted to create a new PIN to
easily access the wallet you just restored.</p>
</div>
<p>You will also need to access your wallet with your mnemonic if you or someone else has
incorrectly entered your PIN 3 times in a row. In this scenario, your app will reset your
PIN and require your mnemonic. This is a security feature to prevent a malicious party
from continually guessing your PIN until they get it right.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="balance-and-transaction-list">
<h2>Balance and Transaction List<a class="headerlink" href="#balance-and-transaction-list" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The main screen you’ll be using in Blockstream Green will display your wallet’s balance in
Bitcoin and its approximate value in your selected fiat currency.</p>
<p>Directly below this will be the <a class="reference external" href="getting-started-index.html#sending-transactions">send</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="getting-started-index.html#receiving-transactions">receive</a>
buttons.</p>
<p>You can also view from this screen all of your wallet’s incoming and outgoing
transactions. Transactions are listed in reverse chronological order, starting with the
most recent transactions at the top.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to see the date, time, amount (in Bitcoin and fiat currency), and
confirmation status of any transactions. You can also select any transaction to get more
information about it, such as its Transaction Hash, which can be used as a
proof-of-payment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="receiving-transactions">
<h2>Receiving Transactions<a class="headerlink" href="#receiving-transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To receive Bitcoin, all you need to do is provide a receiving address to the sender.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/receive.png"><img alt="../../_images/receive.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/receive.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>A Bitcoin receiving address is a string of numbers and letters. You can create a receiving
address by selecting “Receive” from the main screen. Your wallet will generate a new
receiving address each time you prompt it for one. While it is possible to reuse old
addresses, we strongly advise against this because it lessens your privacy.</p>
<p>Once you can see what your new address is, you’ll need to communicate it to the sender.
If you need to send over a distance, a text message or email is an effective way to do it.</p>
<p>If you are physically beside the person who will be sending you Bitcoin, another option is
to use the QR code, which the sender can scan to get the receiving address. This is really
convenient if the sender is using a mobile wallet.</p>
<p>Once someone has sent a transaction to your Blockstream Green wallet, it should appear in
your transaction list page. At first, it will be labelled “unconfirmed”. At this point,
you should not consider the coins to have been received, because the transaction may still
get overwritten or canceled. The transaction will over time accumulate “confirmations” as
new blocks are mined in the Bitcoin network. Once your transaction reaches 6
confirmations, your wallet will list it as “confirmed” and you can consider the coins
received.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sending-transactions">
<h2>Sending Transactions<a class="headerlink" href="#sending-transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To send a transaction, select “Send” from the main screen.</p>
<p>You will need to get the receiving address from the recipient, and enter it (either by
typing or pasting it in, or by scanning the receiver’s QR code).</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/send-receipient.png"><img alt="../../_images/send-receipient.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/send-receipient.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>Then, you can input the amount of Bitcoin that you want to send, and hit send.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/send-amount.png"><img alt="../../_images/send-amount.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/send-amount.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>Your wallet will also automatically calculate a fee for your transaction, which is
necessary to have the network accept it.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/send-review.png"><img alt="../../_images/send-review.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/send-review.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>After you have sent a transaction, you need to wait for the network to confirm it, which
can take a bit of time. You can check the status of a transaction by looking into your
transaction history on the main screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-happens-after-a-transaction-is-sent">
<h2>What Happens After a Transaction Is Sent<a class="headerlink" href="#what-happens-after-a-transaction-is-sent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many new users sometimes wonder why they need to wait for Bitcoin transactions to
complete. Why don’t they happen instantly?</p>
<p>This is because after the transaction has been sent, the sender and receiver’s jobs are
done, but there are still several steps that need to be completed behind the scenes.</p>
<p>To become confirmed, a transaction needs to be included in a block. Blocks are created
every 10 minutes on average, but this is only an average, and can vary from time to time.
Sometimes blocks are found much more quickly (several within a minute) or much slower
(can take over an hour).</p>
<p>Depending on how busy the network is, and how high a fee the sender paid, the transaction
may not be included in the next block.</p>
<p>Once the transaction has been included in a block, it has 1 “confirmation”. Every block
mined after that earns it another confirmation. The industry standard is to wait for 6
confirmations before considering a transaction to be confirmed, at which point you can be
confident that it has been received and can not be reversed or redirected. You will be
able to see the confirmations accumulate on your wallet’s default screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="our-multisignature-model">
<h2>Our Multisignature Model<a class="headerlink" href="#our-multisignature-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Blockstream Green wallets use a special transaction format different from most other
Bitcoin wallets.</p>
<p>Most other storage services in Bitcoin are either “custodial” or “non-custodial without
<em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> security”.</p>
<p>Custodial services, such as exchanges, hold your Bitcoin for you. This also means that
they can confiscate your coins at will, or if they get hacked, your coins can get stolen.
It also usually means KYC identification, and risks of privacy loss.</p>
<p>Other non-custodial wallets do not have those issues, but it also means that if someone
steals your mnemonic or gain access to your wallet, they can steal all of your coins.
The secrecy of your mnemonic is the only thing protecting your coins with these wallets.</p>
<p>With Blockstream Green, you get the benefits of both types.</p>
<p>This is possible because coins in Blockstream Green wallets have two different spend
conditions.</p>
<p>The first way to spend coins is using signatures from 2 different keys to send coins. One
is held by the user in the form of the mnemonic, which the service  never knows. The other
is stored on our server, and we sign your transactions with it after any <em>Two-Factor
Authentication</em> you have enabled verifies the transaction.</p>
<p>This means that, unlike custodial solutions, we can never steal your coins, since we don’t
know your mnemonic. Even if we get hacked, or taken over by a government entity, or
something else catastrophic happens, no one can steal your coins.</p>
<p>On the user side, even if someone steals your mnemonic, they cannot spend your coins
unless they can access your <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em>. This is the type of security that
other wallets do not offer.</p>
<p>The second way to spend coins becomes available after your two factor recovery period
expires. Once this happens,  you can spend your coins without our service needing to also
sign. This is to ensure that no matter what happens, you can always get your coins back.</p>
<p>Our signature scheme also allows us to enforce <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> security, <em>Two-
Factor Authentication</em> spending thresholds, and other extra options. These features do not
exist in typical Bitcoin wallets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="redeposits">
<h2>Redeposits<a class="headerlink" href="#redeposits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As explained above, coins in your main Blockstream Green wallet (or a 2of2 simple account)
require 2 signatures to be spent: one from you and one from Blockstream Green. In order to
protect you from loss of access to your coins should Blockstream Green become unavailable,
there is an alternative spend condition which requires only the user’s signature, provided
that a certain period of time has passed.</p>
<p>If the service becomes unavailable, you simply wait for the specified period (90 days by
default), then sign and send the transaction using our open source recovery tool
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/greenaddress/garecovery">garecovery</a>.</p>
<p>After the expiry period passes, any other limits placed on your spending in Blockstream
Green, such as <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> requirements, cease to be enforceable by the
service.</p>
<p>At this point the wallet will prompt you to redeposit the coins by sending them to
yourself (If you don’t log in to the wallet during this time, and you have email
notifications enabled, the service will email you a reminder as the expiry date gets
closer). The creation of the redeposit transaction resets the expiry period, thereby
re-protecting the coins by once again requiring a Blockstream Green signature to spend
them.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this redeposit transaction is a regular Bitcoin transaction, and as such
is subject to the usual transaction fees for the miners.</p>
<p>You can also adjust the expiry period in your settings if you wish it to be longer or
shorter. A shorter expiry means you need to redeposit more often to maintain your <em>Two-
Factor Authentication</em> security but don’t have to wait as long to recover; a longer expiry
lets you redeposit less often, but you have to wait longer if your <em>Two-Factor
Authentication</em> becomes inaccessible.</p>
