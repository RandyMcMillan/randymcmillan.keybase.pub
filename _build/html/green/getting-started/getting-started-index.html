<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">What Blockstream Green is for</a><a class="headerlink" href="#what-blockstream-green-is-for" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Blockstream Green is a Bitcoin wallet - it’s a way for you to securely receive, store, and
send Bitcoin.</p>
<p>You can use Blockstream Green to accept incoming payments, keep your coins safe for long
periods of time, and to make payments and send Bitcoin to others.</p>
<p>Our wallet allows for convenient, instant access to your coins from a variety of platforms
through mutually compatible applications.</p>
<p>We offer a variety of advanced features, such as letting our users set their own spending
limits, watch-only access for observers, and our unique multisig security model. All of
these (and more) are explained in more detail below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-blockstream-green-isnt-for">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">What Blockstream Green isn’t for</a><a class="headerlink" href="#what-blockstream-green-isnt-for" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is just as important to understand what Blockstream Green isn’t for.</p>
<p>Blockstream Green is not a platform for buying and selling bitcoin. If you wish to buy or
sell bitcoin, you will need to use another method. After you have bought some Bitcoin, you
can send it to your Blockstream Green wallet and receive it by using the wallet’s receive
function.</p>
<p>Blockstream Green only supports Bitcoin (which is denoted by the 3-letter ticker <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BTC</span></code>).
We do not support any national currencies like USD or EUR. We do not support any other
cryptocurrencies, such as Peercoin or Dogecoin. Attempting to send anything other than
Bitcoin to an address generated by a Blockstream Green wallet can result in those coins
being permanently lost. This is completely out of our control, and we are unable to
provide support in this scenario. Before you send any coins to or from your Blockstream
Green wallet, be sure that both the sender and receiver are using the cryptocurrency
denoted by the ticker <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BTC</span></code>.</p>
<p>Always be sure to check the 3-letter currency ticker before sending any coins, and only
use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BTC</span></code> with your Blockstream Green wallet.</p>

<div class="section" id="testnet-versions">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Testnet Versions</a><a class="headerlink" href="#testnet-versions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoin has an alternative network known as ‘testnet’. This testnet network is just like
the real Bitcoin network (which is known as ‘mainnet’), but with worthless coins, so that
people can test features and applications without the risk of losing real coins.</p>
<p>Our wallets can connect to testnet by selecting testnet from the list of networks in the
settings of the login page. If you are new to Bitcoin or Blockstream Green, we urge you to
try things out on testnet first, so that you can get comfortable with how things work
before you start using your real coins.</p>
<p>Wallets, addresses, and coins on the Bitcoin Testnet are completely separate from the real
Bitcoin network. As such, you will need to create and secure a new mainnet wallet after
you are finished with testing and wish to use the real Bitcoin network. Trying to use an
address, or login credentials, or mnemonic from a testnet wallet or service on the Bitcoin
mainnet will not work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="youre-in-control">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">You’re in Control</a><a class="headerlink" href="#youre-in-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Bitcoin is an exciting new technology with many advantages, but it comes with some extra
responsibilities on the users’ end. As a Bitcoin wallet provider, we at Blockstream Green
do not actually grant access to your Bitcoin - you do.</p>
<p>We are a non-custodial wallet. We provide you with the tools to manage your coins. Even if
we disappear, you still retain access to your Bitcoin. This is contrasted with a custodial
service, which holds coins on behalf of its users.</p>
<p>In a custodial system, the service is solely responsible for securing users coins.
Examples include a bank or cryptocurrency exchange that has a verification process for new
users, and then receives, stores, and sends coins on their users’ behalf, as long as they
can verify their identity. This kind of service can deny users access or confiscate their
coins at their own discretion or as a result of pressure from authorities.</p>
<p>This is not possible with Blockstream Green, as we are a non-custodial service. Each user
exclusively controls their own Bitcoin, and it’s not possible for Blockstream Green to
unilaterally move your coins. As long as you follow the instructions provided, you remain
in complete control of your coins, and are solely responsible for retaining access to
them.</p>
<p>Because of this, there are some differences between our services and user responsibilities
and more traditional financial tools and services. Be sure to read the Setting Up a Wallet
section for details; pay close attention to the recommended practices outlined there.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="were-free-but-bitcoin-isnt">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">We’re Free! (But Bitcoin Isn’t)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#were-free-but-bitcoin-isnt" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Blockstream Green is a completely free service - we do not earn any revenue from our
users, we neither collect, nor use any of their data.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that all Bitcoin transactions require a fee that is built in
as part of the Bitcoin protocol. This fee is paid to the miners who run expensive
equipment to secure the Bitcoin network and confirm users’ transactions.</p>
<p>There is no benefit to Blockstream Green for our users to pay high fees, and we do our
best to provide our users with tools and strategies to keep their fees low. At certain
times, however, factors beyond our control can lead to high fees when sending Bitcoin.</p>
<p>We do not ever receive these fees, and so have no way to return any fees to users after a
transaction has been confirmed. We always show the fee that a transaction will pay so you
can verify or change it before you make your transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="whats-special-about-blockstream-green">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">What’s Special About Blockstream Green</a><a class="headerlink" href="#whats-special-about-blockstream-green" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For those that are already familiar with how Bitcoin wallets typically work, you may know
about some of the convenience, security, and privacy features that using Bitcoin offers.</p>
<p>Thanks to our unique multi-signature format, we’re able to offer all the usual privacy and
freedom of typical Bitcoin wallets, but with extra security.</p>
<p>We use a format that requires signatures generated by 2 different keys, one of which is
controlled by you, and one of which is controlled by our service. The service will sign
transactions as long as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) confirmation – a one time password
delivered to you ideally on a separate device via Google Authenticator, email, SMS or call
– is given. This means that even if someone gets a hold of your mnemonic, they still can’t
steal your coins when you have 2FA enabled, unless they also compromise your 2FA method.</p>
<p>The process also stays trust minimized - even if, for some reason, the service cannot sign
your transaction, you can independently move your coins without the service after a chosen
period of time has passed.</p>
<p>This gets you the best of both worlds - the full financial sovereignty and trustlessness
of a non-custodial Bitcoin wallet along with the extra layer of server-enforced two factor
security.</p>
<p>Our design enables a lot of cool features, many of which are not available in other
wallets:</p>

<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Easy access from anywhere</p></li>

<p>Each of our apps can also be used on Bitcoin’s testnet, which we recommend for testing new

<p>After you’ve installed the app, you’ll have the option to log in with an existing mnemonic
, or create a new wallet. To start, click on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Create</span> <span class="pre">New</span> <span class="pre">Wallet</span></code>.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/landing.png"><img alt="../../_images/landing.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/landing.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>At this point, the app will generate a 24-word mnemonic to function as a backup login
method for your wallet. (Our wallets use <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki">the BIP39 standard</a> for generating your
mnemonic and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki">BIP32</a> to derive private keys from that mnemonic).</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/menmonic-warning.png"><img alt="../../_images/menmonic-warning.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/menmonic-warning.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>
<p><strong>Your mnemonic is the single most important piece of information associated with your
wallet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You must write it down somewhere safe and secret - it’s your ultimate backup.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>It must be kept safe and accessible because if your app gets uninstalled, or your device
gets lost or stolen, or you forget your PIN, or your PIN gets reset, then your mnemonic
will let you access your coins again. Even if we at Blockstream Green get shut down or
disappear, you can still retain control of your coins as long as you have your mnemonic.</p>
<p>It must be kept secret because if someone else can figure out or steal your mnemonic, they
may be able to steal your coins (although if you have <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> set up,
they will need to bypass that as well…but we’ll cover that in the <a class="reference external" href="../troubleshooting-advanced/troubleshooting-advanced-index.html#two-factor-authentication">Two-Factor
Authentication section</a> ).</p>
<p>To ensure that you safely recorded your mnemonic, you will be prompted to re-enter several
of the words in the correct order.</p>

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Remember:
<strong>we don’t store your mnemonic in the Blockstream Green database, so we are not able to
tell what it is if you lose it.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>It is also crucial to <strong>never</strong> send your mnemonic over email or text to anyone (
including Blockstream Green support).</p>
<p>Doing so can expose your mnemonic to theft, and put your coins at risk. If you ever
forget and accidentally do this, we urge you to create a brand new wallet as soon as
possible and move your coins to that new wallet.</p>

<div class="section" id="choose-a-pin-for-this-wallet">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Choose a PIN for this Wallet</a><a class="headerlink" href="#choose-a-pin-for-this-wallet" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After you have recorded and confirmed your mnemonic, you will be able to choose a PIN.
This is a 6 digit number that can be used to quickly access your wallet on that device and
on that network.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/PIN-create.png"><img alt="../../_images/PIN-create.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/PIN-create.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>In addition to the PIN you may also use iOS TouchID or Android’s Authentication to ease
access to the wallet you just created or restored. You can set this up from settings.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>It is important to keep your PIN safe and secret. If it is lost, your only option to
re-access your wallet will be through your mnemonic.</p>
</div>
<p>Your <strong>PIN is specific to the device and network</strong> that it is created on. It is possible
to access your wallet from multiple devices by using your mnemonic, but you will create a
separate PIN for each device, so they might not be the same.</p>
<p>As a security feature, your device will reset your PIN if you or someone else enters the
wrong PIN 3 times in a row. This is to prevent a malicious party from continually
guessing until they get your PIN right.</p>
<p>If your PIN is reset, you will need to enter your mnemonic through <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Restore</span> <span class="pre">Green</span>
<span class="pre">Wallet</span></code> on the “Onboarding” screen, which will allow you to create a new PIN for that

<p>Finally, after you have recorded and confirmed your mnemonic and set your PIN, you will be
prompted to choose a <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> method. A <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em>

<p>While optional, we urge you to activate at least one <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> method.
Ideally, you should add at least 2 different <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> options.</p>
</div>
<p>For various reasons, our users sometimes lose access to one of their <em>Two-Factor
Authentication</em> methods, and this can be very inconvenient.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>You can mitigate this risk by having at least 2 different <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em>
methods in place.</p>
<p>This way, if you suddenly lose access to one, you can still retain full access to your
wallet, and then reset the lost <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> method (for more details on
this, see the section for <a class="reference external" href="../troubleshooting-advanced/troubleshooting-advanced-index.html#changing-your-two-factor-authentication-settings">changing a Two-Factor authentication method</a>).</p>
</div>
<p>Using <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> is simple: whenever you take an action that requires
<em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> authorization (sending a transaction, or changing your
<em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> settings), you will confirm the action by providing a
confirmation code that you will receive via your preferred <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em>
method.</p>

<p><em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> is most secure when it is separated from the wallet device.</p>

<p>Creating a wallet for the first time is a straightforward process, but there are a couple
of common mistakes that new Bitcoin users make.</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>
<p>Not properly recording your mnemonic at the beginning might lead you to lose your
funds.</p>
</div>
<p>Though it might be inconvenient at the time, and you might be excited to use the wallet
immediately, it is very important to take the time to properly record your mnemonic and
safely store it.</p>
<p>Some other wallets allow users to start transacting without recording their mnemonic.
While this might seem OK, we believe that this is risky and irresponsible.</p>
<p>It is very easy for users to start accepting and sending bitcoins and delay properly
recording their mnemonic. Then, when something goes wrong in the future (their phone
breaks, the PIN is entered incorrectly, etc), they suddenly lose access to their their
coins.</p>
<p>Take extra-care to safely note and store your 24-words mnemonic. Please take this process
very seriously, and give it the time and attention that it needs.</p>
<p>—</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>
<p>Using a throw-away email address for your <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> can also result
in loss of coins!</p>
</div>
<p>Unless you immediately create more permanent alternative <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em>
methods (which we recommend anyway), or ensure you retain access to this throw-away email
address losing access to your email can be very inconvenient.</p>
<p>Make sure you use an email address that you will be able to access in the future.</p>
<p>—</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>
<p>Creating a new wallet while there is an existing wallet on the app could prevent you
from being able to access this new wallet, unless you safely store this new wallet
mnemonic.</p>
</div>
<p>You will be allowed to create as many wallets as you like on your Blockstream Green app,
but it can only store one PIN-protected mnemonic at a time. This means that any new
wallets won’t be PIN-accessible on that device, and in the future must be logged into
using the full mnemonic.</p>
<p>If you wish to create a new wallet, and have your app store a PIN for the new one, you
will need to first disable the PIN on the original wallet. You can do this by entering an
incorrect PIN 3 times in a row, or from settings after you have logged in.</p>

<p>After you have created your wallet, you will be presented with a login screen when you
open the app.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/PIN.png"><img alt="../../_images/PIN.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/PIN.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>Here, you can enter your PIN, which will grant you access to your wallet. This will work
in the vast majority of situations.</p>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Attention</p>
<p>If you have forgotten your PIN, you will need to enter your 24-word mnemonic to access
your wallet. After you have done this, you will be prompted to create a new PIN to
easily access the wallet you just restored.</p>
</div>
<p>You will also need to access your wallet with your mnemonic if you or someone else has
incorrectly entered your PIN 3 times in a row. In this scenario, your app will reset your
PIN and require your mnemonic. This is a security feature to prevent a malicious party
from continually guessing your PIN until they get it right.</p>

<div class="section" id="balance-and-transaction-list">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">Balance and Transaction List</a><a class="headerlink" href="#balance-and-transaction-list" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The main screen you’ll be using in Blockstream Green will display your wallet’s balance in
Bitcoin and its approximate value in your selected fiat currency.</p>
<p>Directly below this will be the <a class="reference external" href="getting-started-index.html#sending-transactions">send</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="getting-started-index.html#receiving-transactions">receive</a>
buttons.</p>
<p>You can also view from this screen all of your wallet’s incoming and outgoing
transactions. Transactions are listed in reverse chronological order, starting with the
most recent transactions at the top.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to see the date, time, amount (in Bitcoin and fiat currency), and
confirmation status of any transactions. You can also select any transaction to get more
information about it, such as its Transaction Hash, which can be used as a
proof-of-payment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="receiving-transactions">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">Receiving Transactions</a><a class="headerlink" href="#receiving-transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To receive Bitcoin, all you need to do is provide a receiving address to the sender.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/receive.png"><img alt="../../_images/receive.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/receive.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>A Bitcoin receiving address is a string of numbers and letters. You can create a receiving
address by selecting “Receive” from the main screen. Your wallet will generate a new
receiving address each time you prompt it for one. While it is possible to reuse old
addresses, we strongly advise against this because it lessens your privacy.</p>
<p>Once you can see what your new address is, you’ll need to communicate it to the sender.
If you need to send over a distance, a text message or email is an effective way to do it.</p>
<p>If you are physically beside the person who will be sending you Bitcoin, another option is
to use the QR code, which the sender can scan to get the receiving address. This is really
convenient if the sender is using a mobile wallet.</p>
<p>Once someone has sent a transaction to your Blockstream Green wallet, it should appear in
your transaction list page. At first, it will be labelled “unconfirmed”. At this point,
you should not consider the coins to have been received, because the transaction may still
get overwritten or canceled. The transaction will over time accumulate “confirmations” as
new blocks are mined in the Bitcoin network. Once your transaction reaches 6
confirmations, your wallet will list it as “confirmed” and you can consider the coins
received.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sending-transactions">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">Sending Transactions</a><a class="headerlink" href="#sending-transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To send a transaction, select “Send” from the main screen.</p>
<p>You will need to get the receiving address from the recipient, and enter it (either by
typing or pasting it in, or by scanning the receiver’s QR code).</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/send-receipient.png"><img alt="../../_images/send-receipient.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/send-receipient.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>Then, you can input the amount of Bitcoin that you want to send, and hit send.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/send-amount.png"><img alt="../../_images/send-amount.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/send-amount.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>Your wallet will also automatically calculate a fee for your transaction, which is
necessary to have the network accept it.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/send-review.png"><img alt="../../_images/send-review.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/send-review.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>After you have sent a transaction, you need to wait for the network to confirm it, which
can take a bit of time. You can check the status of a transaction by looking into your
transaction history on the main screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-happens-after-a-transaction-is-sent">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">What Happens After a Transaction Is Sent</a><a class="headerlink" href="#what-happens-after-a-transaction-is-sent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Many new users sometimes wonder why they need to wait for Bitcoin transactions to
complete. Why don’t they happen instantly?</p>
<p>This is because after the transaction has been sent, the sender and receiver’s jobs are
done, but there are still several steps that need to be completed behind the scenes.</p>
<p>To become confirmed, a transaction needs to be included in a block. Blocks are created
every 10 minutes on average, but this is only an average, and can vary from time to time.
Sometimes blocks are found much more quickly (several within a minute) or much slower
(can take over an hour).</p>
<p>Depending on how busy the network is, and how high a fee the sender paid, the transaction
may not be included in the next block.</p>
<p>Once the transaction has been included in a block, it has 1 “confirmation”. Every block
mined after that earns it another confirmation. The industry standard is to wait for 6
confirmations before considering a transaction to be confirmed, at which point you can be
confident that it has been received and can not be reversed or redirected. You will be
able to see the confirmations accumulate on your wallet’s default screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="our-multisignature-model">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">Our Multisignature Model</a><a class="headerlink" href="#our-multisignature-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Blockstream Green wallets use a special transaction format different from most other
Bitcoin wallets.</p>
<p>Most other storage services in Bitcoin are either “custodial” or “non-custodial without
<em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> security”.</p>
<p>Custodial services, such as exchanges, hold your Bitcoin for you. This also means that
they can confiscate your coins at will, or if they get hacked, your coins can get stolen.
It also usually means KYC identification, and risks of privacy loss.</p>
<p>Other non-custodial wallets do not have those issues, but it also means that if someone
steals your mnemonic or gain access to your wallet, they can steal all of your coins.
The secrecy of your mnemonic is the only thing protecting your coins with these wallets.</p>
<p>With Blockstream Green, you get the benefits of both types.</p>
<p>This is possible because coins in Blockstream Green wallets have two different spend
conditions.</p>
<p>The first way to spend coins is using signatures from 2 different keys to send coins. One
is held by the user in the form of the mnemonic, which the service  never knows. The other
is stored on our server, and we sign your transactions with it after any <em>Two-Factor
Authentication</em> you have enabled verifies the transaction.</p>
<p>This means that, unlike custodial solutions, we can never steal your coins, since we don’t
know your mnemonic. Even if we get hacked, or taken over by a government entity, or
something else catastrophic happens, no one can steal your coins.</p>
<p>On the user side, even if someone steals your mnemonic, they cannot spend your coins
unless they can access your <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em>. This is the type of security that
other wallets do not offer.</p>
<p>The second way to spend coins becomes available after your two factor recovery period
expires. Once this happens,  you can spend your coins without our service needing to also
sign. This is to ensure that no matter what happens, you can always get your coins back.</p>
<p>Our signature scheme also allows us to enforce <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> security, <em>Two-
Factor Authentication</em> spending thresholds, and other extra options. These features do not
exist in typical Bitcoin wallets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="redeposits">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id22">Redeposits</a><a class="headerlink" href="#redeposits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As explained above, coins in your main Blockstream Green wallet (or a 2of2 simple account)
require 2 signatures to be spent: one from you and one from Blockstream Green. In order to
protect you from loss of access to your coins should Blockstream Green become unavailable,
there is an alternative spend condition which requires only the user’s signature, provided
that a certain period of time has passed.</p>
<p>If the service becomes unavailable, you simply wait for the specified period (90 days by
default), then sign and send the transaction using our open source recovery tool
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/greenaddress/garecovery">garecovery</a>.</p>
<p>After the expiry period passes, any other limits placed on your spending in Blockstream
Green, such as <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> requirements, cease to be enforceable by the
service.</p>
<p>At this point the wallet will prompt you to redeposit the coins by sending them to
yourself (If you don’t log in to the wallet during this time, and you have email
notifications enabled, the service will email you a reminder as the expiry date gets
closer). The creation of the redeposit transaction resets the expiry period, thereby
re-protecting the coins by once again requiring a Blockstream Green signature to spend
them.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this redeposit transaction is a regular Bitcoin transaction, and as such
is subject to the usual transaction fees for the miners.</p>
<p>You can also adjust the expiry period in your settings if you wish it to be longer or
shorter. A shorter expiry means you need to redeposit more often to maintain your <em>Two-
Factor Authentication</em> security but don’t have to wait as long to recover; a longer expiry
lets you redeposit less often, but you have to wait longer if your <em>Two-Factor
Authentication</em> becomes inaccessible.</p>
