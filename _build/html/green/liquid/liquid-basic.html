<li><p>Labeled assets with human readable names, you can check more info by tapping on the
asset card to see the asset details. Only assets
submitted by their issuers to the <a class="reference internal" href="../../liquid/technical_overview.html#to-issued-assets"><span class="std std-ref">Asset Registry</span></a> have
human readable, non-editable labeling data by default.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlabeled assets identified by a 64 hexadecimal characters-long string, and with no
denomination Ticker. In the next upgrade you’ll be able to customize these “raw
assets” with labeling data of your choice by tapping on the asset card to edit the
asset details.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="asset-details">
<h2>Asset Details<a class="headerlink" href="#asset-details" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Depending on whether the asset’s issuer registered the asset or not, you will see the non-
editable <a class="reference external" href="liquid-index.html#registered-assets">asset data</a> or just the
<a class="reference external" href="liquid-index.html#raw-assets">raw identifier of the asset and the customizable fields</a>
to label the asset yourself.</p>

<p>Here you can see a series of metadata defined by the asset issuer:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>the official Name of the asset,</p></li>
<li><p>the Asset ID, a 64 hexadecimal characters long unique identifier of the asset, used
on the network to identify the asset,</p></li>
<li><p>the Total Balance of the asset that you currently own in your wallet,</p></li>
<li><p>the decimal Precision, which defines how many satoshis of an asset should be
interpreted as a whole unit. A 2 decimals precision would imply that 199 satoshis of
an asset should be displayed as 1.99. Your wallet already displays all the amounts of
each asset using the precision specified under this field.</p></li>
<li><p>the Ticker is a 3 or 4 characters shortening of the asset name, used to denominate
all of the amounts of this asset with a recognizable abbreviation,</p></li>
<li><p>the Issuer domain, which is used to tie together all of the above information to the
issuing entity that also controls the domain submitted to the registry. This
information is critical for the user to visually validate that an asset with a
certain Name and a specific Ticker really belongs to the right issuer.</p></li>

<p>Issued Assets without a record on the Asset Registry will not have the same richness in
information as registered assets.</p>
<p>You can anyway see a very important piece of information, which is the Asset ID. This 64
hexadecimal characters long string is the unique identifier of any asset, and you should
always check with the asset issuer that you received an asset that matches their specified
Asset ID. The asset issuer should always publish the ID of any asset they issue, otherwise
anyone could cheaply create a bogus asset and defraud you by sending a worthless asset.</p>

<div class="section" id="receiving-l-btc-and-issued-assets">
<h2>Receiving L-BTC and Issued Assets<a class="headerlink" href="#receiving-l-btc-and-issued-assets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To receive Liquid Bitcoin or any other Issued Asset, all you need to do is provide a
receiving address to the sender.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/receive-liquid.png"><img alt="../../_images/receive-liquid.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/receive-liquid.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>A Liquid receiving address is a string of numbers and letters. You can create a receiving
address by selecting “Receive” from the main screen.</p>
<p>All addresses in Liquid are, by default, blinded using
<a class="reference internal" href="../../liquid/developer-guide/developer-guide-index.html#to-confidential-transactions"><span class="std std-ref">Confidential Transactions</span></a>. Blinding is the process
by which the amount and type of asset being transferred is cryptographically hidden from
everyone except the sending and receiving parties.</p>
<p>Your wallet will generate a new receiving address each time you prompt it for one. While
it is possible to reuse old addresses, we strongly advise against this because it lessens
your privacy.</p>
<p>Once you can see what your new address is, you’ll need to communicate it to the sender.
If you need to send over a distance, a text message or email is an effective way to do it.</p>
<p>If you are physically beside the person who will be sending you Bitcoin, another option is
to use the QR code, which the sender can scan to get the receiving address. This is really
convenient if the sender is using a mobile wallet.</p>
<p>Once someone has sent a transaction to your Blockstream Green wallet, it should appear in
your transaction list page. At first, it will be labelled “unconfirmed”.</p>
<p>Transactions on Liquid are <a class="reference internal" href="../../liquid/technical_overview.html#to-blocksigner"><span class="std std-ref">settled with finality after 2 blocks</span></a>,
therefore you can consider your funds to be finally received within 2 or 3 minutes,
under normal network conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sending-transactions">
<h2>Sending Transactions<a class="headerlink" href="#sending-transactions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To send a transaction, select “Send” from the main screen.</p>
<p>You will need to get the receiving address from the recipient, and enter it (either by
typing or pasting it in, or by scanning the receiver’s QR code).</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/send-recipient-liquid.png"><img alt="../../_images/send-recipient-liquid.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/send-recipient-liquid.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>Then, you can select the asset you wish to send and input the amount that you want to send
, and hit send.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/send-amount-liquid.png"><img alt="../../_images/send-amount-liquid.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/send-amount-liquid.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>Your wallet will also automatically calculate a fee for your transaction, which is
necessary to have the network accept it and to avoid Denial of Service.</p>
<p>Finally you can review your transaction and send it after confirming your Two-Factor
Authentication.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/send-review-liquid.png"><img alt="../../_images/send-review-liquid.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/send-review-liquid.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>After you have sent a transaction, it will be <a class="reference internal" href="../../liquid/technical_overview.html#to-blocksigner"><span class="std std-ref">settled with finality after 2 blocks</span></a>, therefore your counterparty will receive the funds within 2 or 3
minutes, under normal network conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="our-multisignature-model">
<h2>Our Multisignature Model<a class="headerlink" href="#our-multisignature-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Blockstream Green wallets use a special transaction format different from most other
Bitcoin wallets.</p>
<p>Most other storage services in Bitcoin are either “custodial” or “non-custodial without
<em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> security”.</p>
<p>Custodial services, such as exchanges, hold your Bitcoin for you. This also means that
they can confiscate your coins at will, or if they get hacked, your coins can get stolen.
It also usually means KYC identification, and risks of privacy loss.</p>
<p>Other non-custodial wallets do not have those issues, but it also means that if someone
steals your mnemonic or gain access to your wallet, they can steal all of your coins.
The secrecy of your mnemonic is the only thing protecting your coins with these wallets.</p>
<p>With Blockstream Green, you get the benefits of both types.</p>
<p>This is possible because coins in Blockstream Green wallets have two different spending
conditions.</p>
<p>The first way to spend coins is using signatures from 2 different keys to send coins. One
is held by the user in the form of the mnemonic, which the service  never knows. The other
is stored on our server, and we sign your transactions with it after any <em>Two-Factor
Authentication</em> you have enabled verifies the transaction.</p>
<p>This means that, unlike custodial solutions, we can never steal your coins, since we don’t
know your mnemonic. Even if we get hacked, or taken over by a government entity, or
something else catastrophic happens, no one can steal your coins.</p>
<p>On the user side, even if someone steals your mnemonic, they cannot spend your coins
unless they can access your <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em>. This is the type of security that
other wallets do not offer.</p>
<p>The second way to spend coins becomes available after your two factor recovery period
expires. Once this happens,  you can spend your coins without our service needing to also
sign. This is to ensure that no matter what happens, you can always get your coins back</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="redeposits">
<h2>Redeposits<a class="headerlink" href="#redeposits" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As explained above, coins in your main Blockstream Green wallet (or a 2of2 simple account)
require 2 signatures to be spent: one from you and one from Blockstream Green. In order to
protect you from loss of access to your coins should Blockstream Green become unavailable,
there is an alternative spend condition which requires only the user’s signature, provided
that a certain period of time has passed.</p>
<p>If the service becomes unavailable, you simply wait for the specified period (65535 blocks
on Liquid, circa 45 days days, by default), then sign and send the transaction using our
open source recovery <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/greenaddress/garecovery">garecovery</a>.</p>
<p>After the expiry period passes, any limits placed on your spending in Blockstream Green,
such as <em>Two-Factor Authentication</em> requirements, cease to be enforceable by the service.</p>
<p>At this point the wallet will prompt you to redeposit the coins by sending them to
yourself (If you don’t log in to the wallet during this time, and you have email
notifications enabled, the service will email you a reminder as the expiry date gets
closer). The confirmation of the redeposit transaction resets the expiry period, thereby
re-protecting the coins by once again requiring a Blockstream Green signature to spend
them.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this redeposit transaction is a regular Liquid transaction, and as such
is subject to the usual network fees.</p>
