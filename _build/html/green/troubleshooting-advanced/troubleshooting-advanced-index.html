<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>If you have lost or forgotten your PIN, you will need to use your mnemonic to
log in. We cannot tell our users their PIN because we do not store it on our database.</p>
</div>
<p>Keep in mind that each PIN is specific to the app installed on a particular device, and is
not universal across multiple apps that access the same wallet. The PIN that you use to
access your wallet from your iPhone is not necessarily the same as the PIN that you use to
access your wallet from your Desktop.</p>
<p>If the PIN is incorrectly entered three times in a row, the app will assume that a
malicious party is trying to gain access to the device, and will no longer accept attempts
to access by PIN. In this scenario, one must use their mnemonic to access their wallet on
that device.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="app-no-longer-accepts-pin">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">App No Longer Accepts PIN</a><a class="headerlink" href="#app-no-longer-accepts-pin" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>If your app no longer accepts your PIN, first check to see if the network
selected in the middle of the landing page page is the correct one, i.e. you should
see <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Bitcoin</span></code> if you created the wallet and PIN on Bitcoin mainnet, or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Liquid</span></code> if
it was a Liquid wallet. Select the correct network to have the app accept your PIN.</p>
</div>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/landing2.png"><img alt="../../_images/landing2.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/landing2.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>If the PIN login option is not available, then it means that your PIN has been reset, and
you will need to use your mnemonic to log in.</p>
<p>This can happen for a variety of reasons including (but not limited to):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>someone entering a PIN incorrectly 3 times in a row</p></li>
<li><p>changes to the base operating system by mobile carriers/mod authors that introduce bugs
or incompatibilities in the native PIN API</p></li>
<li><p>bugs in the phone’s firmware (or networking stack after entering the PIN incorrectly
only once)</p></li>
<li><p>damage to the phone’s filesystem from physical shocks such as being dropped or getting
wet</p></li>
<li><p>settings being overwritten by malware</p></li>
<li><p>incorrect or incomplete OTA system upgrades or app updates</p></li>
<li><p>unexpected phone power loss</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The remedy is the same regardless of the cause: you must use your mnemonic to log in again
.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trouble-entering-mnemonic">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Trouble Entering Mnemonic</a><a class="headerlink" href="#trouble-entering-mnemonic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When entering your mnemonic, enter the words all in lowercase. After you have typed all 24
words, you can press the submit button.</p>
<p>If you are trying to enter your mnemonic and it is not working, then one of three error
messages should appear.</p>
<div class="section" id="invalid-words">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Invalid Words</a><a class="headerlink" href="#invalid-words" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The first possibility is that one or more words are not valid under the mnemonic scheme
that we use. Typically, the words are just misspelled, and they are highlighted in red or
strikethrough.</p>
<p>Correcting or changing the erroneous word(s) may make your mnemonic correct again.</p>
<p>You can also find the list of valid words at:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt">BIP39</a></p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>You may wish to try with similar looking words if one of your words is not
written down clearly.</p>
</div>
<p>If you are missing a word or they are in the wrong order, then you will need to attempt to
recover them using a wallet recovery service or tool, but this is beyond the scope of
support that we can provide.</p>
<p>Also, make sure you are using the latest version of the wallet and that you are using
lower case (small letters) and no commas or other whitespace such as tab, leading or
trailing whitespace.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>If you are copy and pasting your mnemonic into the text box, please try typing
them as sometimes they may have been saved in an incorrect encoding.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="out-of-order-mnemonic-words">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Out of Order Mnemonic Words</a><a class="headerlink" href="#out-of-order-mnemonic-words" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The second possibility is that the words that you have entered are valid words in the
mnemonic scheme, but that one of the words is incorrect (though still a valid word) or
they are in the wrong order. One or more of the words are incorrect, but the app doesn’t
know which one since they are all potentially valid words.</p>
<p>As with the previous error, you may wish to try and investigate which word(s) may have
been recorded incorrectly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="not-a-blockstream-green-wallet-greenaddress-mnemonic">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Not a Blockstream Green Wallet (GreenAddress) Mnemonic</a><a class="headerlink" href="#not-a-blockstream-green-wallet-greenaddress-mnemonic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The third possible error is that the mnemonic is valid, but it doesn’t match anything in
our database. There are several possible causes for this.</p>
<p>It can happen if someone tries to enter a mnemonic from their Blockstream Green testnet
wallet. The testnet and mainnet versions of the wallet are completely separate and
function on different networks.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the mnemonic entered corresponds to a valid private key that
was generated by a Blockstream Green wallet, but that the wallet has since been deleted
by its owner.</p>
<p>Lastly, an error message will appear if someone is trying to restore a wallet that was
created by a separate service. Because Blockstream Green wallets use a special 2of2
multisig address type, mnemonics generated by other services aren’t compatible with our
system. (If you wish to move all coins from an existing non-Blockstream Green wallet into
a Blockstream Green wallet, then you can send them in a transaction, or use the sweep
function.)</p>

<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>If for some reason you have lost your mnemonic, or you suspect that your record
of your mnemonic has been damaged or tampered with, and if you are still able to log
into your wallet with a PIN, then you can view your mnemonic from the settings page to
double-check or re-record them.</p>
</div>
<p>If, however, your wallet no longer accepts your PIN, which can happen for a variety of
reasons, and you have lost your mnemonic, we are unable to assist you in accessing your
wallet. In this situation, your coins may be permanently lost, unless you can recover your
mnemonic.</p>
<p>In the Bitcoin world, it is unfortunately common for users to erroneously record their
24-word mnemonic. One way to avoid this is to double-check that you have correctly
recorded by installing a fresh version of our app on a different device and then testing
it there to see if it works.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lost-device-or-accidental-uninstallation">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Lost Device or Accidental Uninstallation</a><a class="headerlink" href="#lost-device-or-accidental-uninstallation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the only device you use to access your Blockstream Green wallet is lost or stolen, or
for some reason the program gets uninstalled or deleted, you will need to install a fresh
version of the app on some device, and use your mnemonic to restore your wallet.</p>
<p>Once the app is installed, do not choose the option create a new wallet. Instead, you can
restore your existing wallet by entering its mnemonic that you have already recorded.</p>
<p>After this, the app will ask you to create a PIN for that device. It can be the same as
the old one, or you can choose a new one.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>This procedure can also be used if you simply wish to be able to access a single
wallet from multiple devices.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="watch-only-mode">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Watch-Only Mode</a><a class="headerlink" href="#watch-only-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Watch-only mode is a feature that allows the owner of a wallet to create an alternative
login method that can view the activity on a wallet without being able to change any
crucial settings or send coins.</p>
<p>This can be useful for situations if you want to let someone else access your wallet to
get a receiving address or confirm for you that coins have been received.</p>
<p>You can add a watch-only login under the “Network” section of settings. Select “Watch-Only
Login”, and then you can create the new username and password, and press save.</p>
<p>You can return and edit this anytime you are logged in as the wallet’s owner.</p>
<p>To log in with the watch-only login, you need to return to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Onboarding</span></code> screen by
logging out of the main wallet. Then, instead of entering your PIN or mnemonic, tap or
click on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">eye</span> <span class="pre">icon</span></code> on the top right corner of the home screen.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/landing2.png"><img alt="../../_images/landing2.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/landing2.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>This will prompt you to enter the username and password that you chose in settings, and
will grant access to a limited version of the wallet only for viewing transaction history,
receiving transactions, or sweeping a paper wallet or WIF private key.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>You can safely give this username and password out to anyone else who you want to
be able to view your wallet’s activity, without having to trust them not to steal -
they will be unable to ever send coins out of your wallet using this login information.</p>
</div>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Setup PIN and Touch/Face ID</a><a class="headerlink" href="#setup-pin-and-touch-face-id" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Under Settings-&gt;Network, you can find an option that allows you to disable your PIN to log
in.</p>
<p>If you choose to disable the PIN login you will need to enter your full 24-word mnemonic
every time you wish to access your wallet on that device. This can be useful for a
situation where you suspect someone may have access to your device and may be able to
guess your PIN.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>You can also quickly disable, and then immediately enable again as a method to

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Best Two-Factor Authentication Practices</a><a class="headerlink" href="#best-two-factor-authentication-practices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Properly managing your Two-Factor Authentication is one of the most important parts of
using your Blockstream Green wallet, so we strongly recommend that you follow all the
guidelines outlined here.</p>
<div class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Attention</p>
<p>Two-Factor authentication is the security method you use to authorize our
server to provide the second signature for transactions. This means that in order for
someone to steal coins from your wallet, they would need to steal your private key (by
learning your mnemonic, or logging into your device with your PIN), and gain access to
at least one of your Two-Factor authentication methods.</p>
</div>
<p>This is how Blockstream Green offers a higher level of security over other single-
signature wallets, which are compromised the moment someone else learns their mnemonic.</p>
<p>This means, however, that if you lose access to your Two-Factor authentication methods,
your coins can get stuck for long periods of time (~90 days by default).</p>
<p>For best practices, we strongly urge our users to:</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Set up your Two-Factor authentication methods as soon as you set up your wallet.</p></li>
<li><p>Only use a permanent email or phone number that you will retain access to
indefinitely.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up at least two different Two-Factor authentication methods. This allows you to
retain access even if one of your methods fails.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Many of the most common problems that users of Blockstream Green face can be avoided by
following those basic practices.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="changing-your-two-factor-authentication-settings">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Changing Your Two-Factor Authentication Settings</a><a class="headerlink" href="#changing-your-two-factor-authentication-settings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Your Two-Factor authentication settings are all managed through the “Settings” page, under
the Two-Factor section.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p><strong>Set up new Two-Factor authentication method</strong>:</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p><strong>If you already had another Two-Factor authentication method set up</strong>, you will
need to use it to confirm that you wish to make a change.</p>
<p>As long as at least one Two-Factor authentication method is active, you will always
need to provide Two-Factor authentication confirmation for further changing your Two-

<p>In general, it is a good idea to keep more than one Two-Factor authentication
method activated, but this is especially important if SMS is one of your methods.</p>
</div>
<p>This is because it is prone to more problems than other methods due to potential issues on
the end of the phone carrier, connectivity issues in certain regions, and other issues,
making it the least reliable Two-Factor authentication method.</p>
<p>From time to time, users suddenly lose access to their SMS Two-Factor authentication
method for a variety of reasons beyond our control (SMS routing issues, service provider
changes, etc), but there are several things you can do to reduce the chances of this
happening:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For obvious reasons, never use a temporary phone number.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, only set up your SMS Two-Factor authentication method from the location that you
plan on usually using it from. It has happened that users have activated their SMS Two-
Factor authentication while traveling, only to find that routing issues prevent them
from using it when they return home.</p></li>

<div class="admonition note">

<p>Once this happens, every 30 seconds your authenticator app will automatically generate
6-digit codes that can be entered.</p>

<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>
<p>Two-Factor reset is an option of last resort for users that accidentally lose
access to <strong>all</strong> of their Two-Factor authentication methods.</p>
<p>It will require <strong>at least 1 year</strong> before being able to spend the funds with the new
Two-Factor authentication email.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>As long as you retain access to at least one other Two-Factor authentication
method, you will be able to <a class="reference internal" href="#disable-and-change">disable and change</a> the lost Two-Factor authentication
method, and recreate one under your control.</p>
<p>An alternative to re-gain control of your funds is to wait for the redeposit period to
expire and then use our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/greenaddress/garecovery">garecovery</a> tool to send your coins to another wallet.</p>
</div>
<p>This why we strongly recommend having at least two different methods enabled and
accessible at all times.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some users do not follow best practices and will lose their only Two-Factor
authentication (or in extreme circumstances, may be exceptionally unlucky and lose access
to multiple Two-Factor authentication methods at the same time).</p>
<p><strong>Resetting is advisable if, and only if, all of the following are applicable to you</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If you lost access to all of your Two-Factor authentication methods;</p></li>
<li><p>If you do not feel confident in using the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/greenaddress/garecovery">garecovery</a> tool;</p></li>
<li><p>If you do not possess the <a class="reference external" href="./troubleshooting-advanced-index.html#nlocktime">nLockTime.zip files</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Two-Factor reset feature, can be found in the “Settings” page, under the Two-Factor
section.</p>
<p>You start the reset process by entering an email address, which you must confirm.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>Once you have done this the waiting period will begin. The <strong>waiting period
is at least 1 year long</strong> (see below), and a countdown in days will be displayed in
your wallet’s settings.</p>
</div>
<p>If the waiting period goes by without interruption by the wallet’s owner, then email
Two-Factor authentication will be enabled and set to the reset email address. Then you can
again use your wallet as normal, including setting up new Two-Factor authentication
methods.</p>
<p>The long waiting period is a crucial security measure, in case someone temporarily
accessed their wallet and tried to use the reset feature to steal their coins. The waiting
period gives the rightful owner of the wallet time to log in and access their wallet to
dispute the Two-Factor authentication reset.</p>
<p>The exact formula for the waiting period is whichever of these two is longer:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>365 days after the reset is triggered, OR</p></li>
<li><p>365 days plus your nLockTime period after the your wallet’s last transaction</p></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>For example:</dt><dd><p>i. you have your nLockTime period set to 30 days, and your last transaction was 40 days
ago, then the waiting period will be 365 days.</p>
<p>ii. you have your nLockTime period set to 90 days, and you sent a transaction 50 days,
ago, then the waiting period will be 405 days (365 days + 40 days left on your
nLocktime).</p>

<p>One of the many advantages of using Blockstream Green is that you get multi-platform
support - you can access your wallet from different devices on different operating systems
.</p>
<p>To do this, you need to first have a wallet created (on any one of our apps), and have the
mnemonic carefully recorded.</p>
<p>Now, install any version of our app on the secondary device that you wish to use. Once it
is installed, do not create a new wallet. Instead, tap on <cite>Restore Green Wallet</cite> and enter
your 24-word mnemonic from your original wallet.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/landing2.png"><img alt="../../_images/landing2.png" class="align-center" src="../../_images/landing2.png" style="width: 250px;" /></a>
<p>After this, the app will ask you to create a PIN (if there is no other PIN-protected
mnemonic on your device).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>It is important to understand that this is not the same PIN that you use to
enter your wallet in the original device. Each device can be set up with its own PIN.
The mnemonic is common to all devices accessing the same wallet and coins, but each PIN
is specific to the device it was created on.</p>
</div>
<p>Once you have done this, you can freely access your coins from either device, and make
changes as you please. Also, any coins sent or received on one device will be reflected in
all other devices connecting to that same wallet.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, that managing multiple wallets on a single device will mean

<p>Now, you want to create a separate wallet (B). You do this by clicking on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Create</span> <span class="pre">New</span>

<p>When you do this, you will be warned that <strong>you can only have one PIN-protected mnemonic

recover your wallet as you will not be able to set a PIN.</p>

screen every time.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to access this new wallet (B) via PIN, you first need to erase the existing

24-words mnemonic via  the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Restore</span> <span class="pre">Green</span> <span class="pre">Wallet</span></code> in the <em>Onboarding</em> screen.</p>

<p>Now, some of you may note that this isn’t all that convenient, having to re-enter
your mnemonic each time you switch wallets.</p>
<p>That is correct; it’s not a function that we generally recommend our users to use.
Instead, if you wish to keep several different accounts for different groups of coins,
we recommend that you use our simple account feature.</p>

<p>You can also click on any one of the transactions to see extra detailed information about
it. The most common reason to do this is to get a Transaction ID or TXID. This is also
known as a Transaction Hash, and can be shown to other people as a proof-of-payment, since
it allows them to find and verify the transaction for themselves.</p>
<p>Aside from the TXID, there is much more useful information, especially for more advanced

loss of access to your funds should Green become unavailable, Green automatically creates
pre-signed transactions which you can subsequently countersign to recover the funds to an
address controlled solely by you. These transactions are called nLockTime transactions
because they can only be spent and confirmed by the network after a specific period of

that if you lose your 2FA, or if our servers become inaccessible, then you need to wait
longer to to unilaterally move your coins.</p>
<p>nLocktime is measured in blocks, which occur every 10 minutes on average, so our software

<dl class="simple">
<dt>Two-Factor threshold</dt><dd><p>By enabling a Two-Factor threshold, the owner of a wallet can unlock a certain amount of

<p>For example, let’s say that you have 200 mBTC in your wallet, and you want to make sure
that you don’t spend more than 35 mBTC before again .</p>
<p>You could go into your Two-Factor settings to “Two-Factor threshold”, press the it and set
it to 35 mBTC. This would allow you to spend up to a total of 35 mBTC without passing Two-
Factor authentication. Let’s say that you make 3 payments of 10 mBTC over the next week.
The fourth time you attempt to do this, the app will require you to pass 2FA (since you
will only have 5 mBTC left on your spending limit), which can act as a reminder that you
are getting close to your threshold.</p>

<p>Segregated Witness (aka SegWit) was a crucial upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol from 2017,

<p>SegWit is turned on by default in Blockstream Green wallets, and we strongly recommend you

<p>As a brief description of how it works - SegWit generates a special type of receiving
address that makes it cheaper to spend from.</p>
<p>Because this requires spending from SegWit addresses, if you have been using your wallet

<p>If you wish to remove your wallet and all associated data from our system, you will need
to do this from our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/greenaddress/WalletElectron/releases">desktop app</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have logged in, go to Settings, and then find the section marked “Delete wallet”.</p>
<p>Be sure that you have moved all coins out of your wallet before you delete it, since there
is no way to re-access it again afterward.</p>
<p>After you click the delete button, you simply need to confirm your 2FA, and then your
wallet will be permanently deleted, and all associated data pertaining to it will be
deleted from our servers.</p>
